Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing information in a computer so that it can be retrieved and used most productively.
What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A.  Traversing: Accessing each records exactly once so that certain items in the record may be processed.
    Searching: Finding the location of a particular record with a given key value, or finding the location of all records which satisfy one or more conditions.
    Inserting: Adding a new record to the structure.
    Deleting: Removing the record from the structure.
    Sorting: Managing the data or record in some logical order(Ascending or descending order).
    Merging: Combining the record in two different sorted files into a single sorted file.
